 * Whole card on delays?
 * also probably Animate. So call this card Animate instead of "what are you waiting for"




* light up individual pixels first then move onto loops in another card??
* yes and tie in with the animated wipe then
 * set all the pixels on to some colour ... animate with colorWipe? no, do animate on another card, loops can be one concept, delays another
 * choose different colours
 * set brightness as a final tweak

 * how does it behave with pixel index out of range? Two possible scenarios... index bigger than the length in code, index bigger than length in real life.
