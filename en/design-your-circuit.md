1. Gather all your NeoPixels and some chalk or a pencil.

2. Lay a t-shirt \(or whatever piece of fabric you're making the project on\) out on a flat surface. Arrange the NeoPixels into a shape that you like. I'm going to do a smiley face! Some other ideas are
 * A straight line
 * A heart (eight NeoPixels is perfect for this)
 * Pretend "buttons" down the front of a t-shirt

3. Trace around the outside and the inside of the shape with the pencil or chalk, marking the spot where each NeoPixel is.

4. Decide roughly where you plan to have the Flora and choose one NeoPixel for it to be connected to: this will be the first one you start sewing on. The rest will be connected to each other one by one in a chain.

4. You will be sewing on the NeoPixels in one continuous line, with the Flora attached to one end. Decide roughly where you plan to have the Flora and work out which NeoPixel it will be connected to: this is the start of your line.
 * The aim is to trace out the line in such a way that it does not cross over itself \(this would cause problems with a short circuit!\)
 
5. Look closely at the NeoPixels. Do you see the little arrows?
 Starting with the first, \(the one you just picked out\), turn each NeoPixel so that its arrows point to the next one in the chain. You should be able to trace out one continuous line along the arrows from the first NeoPixel to the last.
 * The aim is to trace out the line in such a way that it does not cross over itself \(this would cause problems with a short circuit!\)
 
6. Ready to start sewing? Once you have everything marked out, set aside all the pieces and grab a needle and some conductive thread. About 20cm should be enough to begin with if your NeoPixels are quite close together.
 * If you have an embroidery hoop, place your fabric into it. The whole shape you marked out should fit inside.

7. You will sew the **data** line first. This is identified by the little arrows. Take your first NeoPixel and put it in place, with the arrows pointing towards where the next one will be. Attach it to the fabric by sewing through the pin with the arrow that points **away** from the LED in the centre. This is the **data out** pin. 
 * Be sure to make a secure connection by sewing three or four stitches tightly through the pin.
 
8. Sew a running stitch to the spot where the next NeoPixel will go. Then take the next NeoPixel and place it onto its spot, with the arrows pointing away from the first one and towards the next spot. 

9. Attach it by sewing through the pin with the arrow that points **in towards** the LED in the centre. This is the **data in** pin. Secure the thread with a few stitches at the back of the fabric and cut it short.
 * It is recommended to coat the ends of the thread with clear nail polish after cutting, to prevent fraying and avoid stray threads from causing a short circuit.
 
10. Using a _new piece of conductive thread_, connect the **data out** pin of the second NeoPixel to the **data in** pin of the third NeoPixel. Continue in this way until all the NeoPixels are chained together along their **data** pins.
