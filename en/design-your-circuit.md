1. Gather all your NeoPixels and some chalk or a pencil.

2. Lay a t-shirt \(or whatever piece of fabric you're making the project on\) out on a flat surface. Arrange the NeoPixels into a shape that you like. I'm going to do a smiley face! Some other ideas are
 * A straight line
 * A heart (eight NeoPixels is perfect for this)
 * Pretend "buttons" down the front of a t-shirt

3. Trace around the outside and the inside of the shape with the pencil or chalk, marking the spot where each NeoPixel is.

4. You will be sewing on the NeoPixels in one continuous line, with the Flora attached to one end. Decide roughly where you plan to have the Flora and work out which NeoPixel it will be connected to: this is the start of your line.
 * Try to trace out the line in such a way that it does not cross over itself \(this would cause problems with a short circuit!\)
 
5. Look closely at the NeoPixels. Do you see the little arrows?
 Starting with the first NeoPixel, turn each one so that it points to the next 
 
 this will be the first one you start sewing on.
